https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.07871


This ANS code contains the function that computes Autoencoder Node Saliency written in Python 2.7. 

To operate the code, one should have the following Python modules installed:
  - numpy
  - matplotlib

Details on how to generate results described in the paper can be found in the following example.

An example of applying ANS on the MNIST dataset can be found in the Jupyter notebook:
